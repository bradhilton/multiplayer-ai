       "Great choice! **Prisoner's Dilemma** is a classic game in game theory that showcases how two individuals might not cooperate, even if it seems that it's in their best interest to do so. Here's a quick rundown of how you can play it:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Rules:\n",
       "1. **The Scenario**: Imagine both of you have been apprehended for a crime and are being interrogated in separate rooms. You cannot communicate with each other. Each of you has two options: to **Confess** or to **Remain Silent**.\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **The Outcomes**:\n",
       "   - If both of you **Confess**, each of you gets a moderate sentence (say, 5 years in prison).\n",
       "   - If one **Confesses** and the other **Remains Silent**, the confessor will be freed (0 years), considering he provided evidence against the other, who then gets a heavy sentence (say, 10 years).\n",
       "   - If both of you **Remain Silent**, due to lack of evidence, you both get a light sentence (say, 1 year each).\n",
       "\n",
       "### How to Play:\n",
       "- First, decide who will be **Prisoner A** and **Prisoner B**.\n",
       "- Then, independently and without communicating, decide whether you're going to **Confess** or **Remain Silent**.\n",
       "- Once both of you have made your decisions, reveal your choices to each other simultaneously.\n",
       "\n",
       "This game can lead to various outcomes and discussions about rationality, trust, and cooperation. You can play multiple rounds to see how strategies evolve over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Would you like to adapt or add any specific rules for your game, or are you good to go with this setup?\n",
